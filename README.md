# Bolted Satellite Structure Analysis in ANSYS-Mechanical

--The project was done as participation for Inter-company challenge event of Simulation Lab Private Limited. The task included the modelling, simulation, documentation and presentation of the assignment. 

Assignment-
Different types of materials are tested and compared in the satellite structure via simulations. The idea is to find the best material for the structure based on their Margin of Safety (MoS). Based on the best structure material, then bolt materials are tested and compared to find the best out of them.
